# TheNile
 
Final project will be combo of things we have been doing in Tri2. A large part of this is building/refining off of work we have done in AP test Repo.
Project is worth 50 points,

A. Design, Alpha Feb 17 (10 points).

B. Revision 1.0 Feb 24 (10 points)

C. Revision 2.0 End of my Final Day (30 points)

This should be done in a group, to reduce work load on individual. I will be evaluating coding participation by Git quantity & quality of commits.


# Project Overview
1. View is Amazon Product like Theme, UI to mimic amazon.com and/or amazon AP. Presentation of Product, Scrolling Products, Categorized Navigation and Search are GOOD features.

2. Model is focused on Abstract Product Class which is designed to support multiple categories of Products (ie Fresh, Electronic, Tools, and Online Game Center). Model ties to a Database is consider optional, static data can be used in Product Constructors (rich data, ie images is highly encouraged).

3. Control provides elements to tie View to Model. For instance, a Linked List of Products. Initiating constructors for all the Products and Providing interfaces between Model and View.

4. View and Model should  have contract on Abstract interfaces to assist in independent development. The Product Class abstract interfaces are made to assist in Presenting content. Product could have simple (abstract interface) and detail views (extended Class by Product type).

5. Things like shopping cart are optional, they could be extra point builders. However, focus should be on #1-4.
